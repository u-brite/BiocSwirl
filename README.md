## Background {#background}

Bioinformatics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that incorporates biological, statistical and computer science based knowledge to provide in-depth analysis and interpretation of biological data. There are a number of resources available to individuals interested in learning bioinformatics and these include: workshops, videos,and online tutorials. However, workshops can be time limiting, videos lack the ability to troubleshoot, and online tutorials can lack meaningful feedback and interactivity aside from copying and pasting codes. Our project seeks to create an interactive lesson using the learnR format and aims to provide a user-friendly and interactive learning environment that allows students to learn at their own pace.

For this hackathon we adapted the [Analyzing PBMC scATAC-seq tutorial](https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette.html) from the Satija Lab into a more interactive LearnR format. This tutorial looks at the analysis of single cell ATAC-seq data of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on the 10X Genomics Platform. Single cell ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) is a method that looks at open chromatin regions at the genome level at a single cell resolution. Our lessons aim to teach learners not only the background of this technology, but also the analysis of this data type from preprocessing to integrating with scRNAseq data. More information is included in the workflow from the diagram below.

## Data {#data}

The data used is from the 10X genomics website. It contains a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The files below will be downloaded by the tutorial itself, so there is no need to download it.

-   [The Raw data](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-atac/1.0.1/atac_v1_pbmc_10k/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_filtered_peak_bc_matrix.h5)
-   [The Metadata](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-atac/1.0.1/atac_v1_pbmc_10k/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_singlecell.csv)
-   The [fragments file](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-atac/1.0.1/atac_v1_pbmc_10k/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_fragments.tsv.gz) 
-   The [fragments file index](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-atac/1.0.1/atac_v1_pbmc_10k/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_fragments.tsv.gz.tbi)
